# NFT Marketplace
## Project Description
This project is a decentralized NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, list, and trade NFTs in a secure and transparent manner.
The marketplace is powered by a Solidity smart contract that handles all the core logic, including token creation, ownership, and transactions.
